Key Use Cases of HEAD in a REST API

 - Resource Existence Check: 
    You can check if a resource exists or if it has been modified without downloading it.
    
 - Metadata Retrieval: 
    You can retrieve headers such as Content-Type, Content-Length, or Last-Modified to inspect the resource without fetching the full content.
    
 - Cache Validation: 
    Use HEAD to check the cache-related headers (ETag, Last-Modified) before deciding to fetch the full resource with GET.
    

Can be useful for FILE resources :
 - Request:
    HEAD /files/sample.pdf HTTP/1.1
 - Response:
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/pdf
    Content-Length: 102400

Examples for Book entity:

1) Check if a Book Exists (without fetching its content)
Status : 200 or 404

2) Check for Resource Changes / Cache Validation

  HEAD /books/{id} HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  If-None-Match: "etag-value"

Response (if the book hasn't changed):
  HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified

Response (if the book has changed):
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Length: 256
  ETag: "new-etag-value"
